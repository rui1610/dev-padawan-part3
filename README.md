# Dev Padawan - Part 3

## Recently at Dev Padawans - what you've learned so far

- Python is a cool programming language
- You know how to run a Python application
- Not every computer is setup in the same way

## Your new challenge

In this exercise we'll overcome the issues with different system setups. For that we'll combine two technologies:

- Docker containers
- Development containers in Visual Studio Code

We'll also look into other setup information that is needed in Python if you want to re-use Python libraries allowing you to e.g. easily create PowerPoint slide decks.

TBD
